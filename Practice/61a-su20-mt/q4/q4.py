    A lemon-copy is a perfect replica of a nested list's box-and-pointer structure.
        If an environment diagram were drawn out, the two should be entirely
        separate but identical.

    A `xv` is a list that only contains ints and other lists.

    The function `lemon` generates a lemon-copy of the given list `xv`.

    Note: The `isinstance` function takes in a value and a type and determines
        whether the value is of the given type. So

        >>> isinstance("abc", str)
        True
        >>> isinstance("abc", list)
        False

    Here's an example, where lemon_y = lemon(y)
