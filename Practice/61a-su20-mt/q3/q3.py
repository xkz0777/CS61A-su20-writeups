Let a `painting` be a self-referential function that
    - takes in one integer
    - returns two values, another painting and well as an integer

For an example see the function `identity_painting` below.

You have two tasks in this assignment, to implement the functions `microscope`
and `plush`. Both have their behavior defined by their doctests.

It is not necessary to implement `microscope` correctly to get the points for
`plush`. However, the ok test cases for `plush` will fail if you have not correctly
implemented `microscope`.
